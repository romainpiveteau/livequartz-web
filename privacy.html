<H2> Information We Collect and We don't collect </H2>
	 - While LiveQuartz Lite is used in "Limited" mode (free), it shares some usage events with <a href="https://mixpanel.com">Mixpanel</a> (like use of a tool, exports, add of a layer, filter, buy, subscribe, renew, etc...). It never shares any personal informations (name, addresses, phone numbers, email, MAC or IP adresses) or some potential sensible or personal data like pixels you have opened or generated in your documents.<br><br>
- When LiveQuartz is used in "Unlimited" mode (either in the paid application or in the free application while an in-app purchase or a subscription is active), only crashes can be collected and sent to the <a href="https://hockeyapp.net">Microsoft App Center (HockeyApp)</a> or Apple systems (with user's agreement) to help the developer detect and enhance the quality of the software.

<H2> Renewable subscriptions and Free Trial Period Terms </H2>
A subscription to LiveQuartz Unlimited (no usage limit on exportations) is valid for a chosen period. When subscribing, if you are on latest versions of macOS, you have the choice between different durations (and prices). The first time you subscribe (except for one week subscriptions), you get a three days free trial period with full access. <b>If you don't want to continue and be charged, you have to go to <a href="https://apps.apple.com/account/subscriptions">the subscription management page</a> and unsubscribe before the end of the 3 days period.</b> If you do nothing, payment will be charged to your App Store Account then. Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase. Your subscription management page can also be accessed from the Help menu of LiveQuartz in "LiveQuartz Unlimited Subscription management".
